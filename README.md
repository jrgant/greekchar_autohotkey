# AutoHotkey Hotstrings for Greek Characters

## R Script

The R code scrapes a table from [keynotesupport.com](http://keynotesupport.com) of Alt codes, Unicode, and HTML entities for Greek characters and writes a series of [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) hotstrings to a .txt file.


## .TXT File

The .txt file contains all of the hotstrings for Greek characters. A couple of strings like ```\sigmaf``` need to be changed, as ```\sigma``` will trigger a substitution. Change as needed upon pasting these into an AutoHotkey file.
